I'm Chris, a full time geek and student of Computer Science and
Electronic Engineering in the UK. My passion is to build great
software, often late at night.

I'm currently looking for a **job**! Take a look at my [CV]({{ '/cv' | relative_url }})
and drop me an [email](mailto:chrisc.101@gmail.com), I'd love to have
a chat. ;-)
